=head1 NAME

mqdb-sendmail - part of the Mail::Queue::DB suite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

mqdb-sendmail <sendmail options>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

mqdb-sendmail accepts a mail on standard input and writes it, as well as the 
sendmail options it receives on the commandline to a Berkley Database.

The default database location is $HOME/.mqdb_email.db but this can
be overridden by setting the environment variable $MQDB_DB

Typically you would tell your mail client to use mqdb-sendmail for sending 
email, through its configuration file... examples for pine and mutt are:

muttrc: set sendmail="/usr/bin/mqdb-sendmail -oem -oi"

pinerc: sendmail-path=/usr/bin/mqdb-sendmail -oem -t -oi
