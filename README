DESCRIPTION

   Mail::Queue::DB allows one to create a local outgoing email store in 
   Berkel DB format.  This mail can then be flushed over SSH or some other 
   connection to an appropriate mailhost.  This module and the associated
   tools work well on systems like laptops that need to be able to send
   mail while offline.  It was designed to be complementary to
   OfflineIMAP.


INSTALLATION

   Follow the standard recipe:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test

   If all tests pass, then run:

   $ make install
